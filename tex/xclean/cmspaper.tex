% --- ABSTRACT -----------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{abstract}
Physics analysis in CMS is based on the reconstruction of high-level objects
like electrons, photons, muons, taus, and jets. However, energy depositions in
the detector are not uniquely assigned to one reconstructed physics object but
can contribute to several of them. This leads to an overlap of the objects and
a double counting of energy.

This note discusses a cross-cleaning package which provides algorithms to
identify the overlap of any two objects. The package provides a framework to
correct objects for the double counted energy and to remove dublicates. The
cross-cleaning package is designed to run on {\sc PAT} objects.

\section{Introduction}

In CMS event reconstruction each type of physics object is build from the
detector information by a dedicated algorithm, independent from the
reconstruction of other kinds of objects. It is not uncommon in this procedure
that two or more object of different type end up with common constituents.
While algorithms for object identification usually select 'good' objects
from all reconstructed ones within the same collection, the ambiguity between two
objects in distinct collections can still remain. This multiple counting of
energy must be avoided in order to obtain an optimal energy resolutions of these
objects. This is especially true for the missing transverse energy (MET).

Overlapping objects must be identified and the energy be assigned uniquely to
one of the candidates. The details of such a cleaning are of course depending on
the object definition and therefore paticular to each analysis.  In this note a
cross-cleaning package~\cite{package} is discussed, that is flexible enough to
allow the implementation of differnet splitting algorithm between objects.
If more than two objects share energy, circular dependencies may arise. These
possible interferences are dealed with, so that the outcome of cross-cleaned
objects does not depend on the order in which the cleaning algorithms are
called.

Input to the cleaning are collections of physics objects which pass the
identification requirements chosen for the particular analysis. The
cross-cleaning does not replace a selection on object quality but is meant to
remove the remaining ambiguities.

% *** THE CROSS-CLEANING FRAMEWORK *********************************************

\section{The Cross-Cleaning-Algorithm Framework}
The cross-cleaning is performed in two steps: First binary cleaners are called.
These are specialized algorithms that search for conflicts in two distinct
collections, determine the shared energy for two overlapping objects and decide
how to deal with it. This can for example be an electron-vs.-jet cleaner, a
muon-vs.-jet cleaner etc.. These binary cleaners do not apply any corrections
on either of the two input collections, but save the result of the cleaning
algorithms in an internal map.

The key entry in this map is a reference to the object that should be corrected
while the associated value contains the object which is causing this correction
and the information how the object should be corrected. This scheme is
illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:Cleaning}. The correction is given by a
energy-momentum fourvector.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{figures/CleaningMap.eps}
\caption{Schematic view of the input and result of different cleaning
    algorithms. Each algorithm takes two object collections as input and
    creates an entry in the internal cross-cleaning map for each object
    that should be modified.}
\label{fig:Cleaning}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a second step, this temporary buffer map is scanned for possible conflicts.
If the same object {\it A} is causing a correction to object {\it B} but should
be corrected itself because of object {\it C}, then it might happen that after
the correction of {\it A} the correction of {\it B} is no longer necessary or at
least different.
% to the case where first {\it B} is corrected and then {\it A}.
% right, but this case we do not take care of ...
The result of the cross-cleaning must not depend on the order in which objects
are compared, therefore conflicts are resolved before any object is being
modified (cp. section \ref{mapReso}).

%%@@ This needs to be revised
%Possible conflicts can be resolved since all decisions of the cleaning
%algorithms are saved in the internal map and not yet applied on the objects.
%The
%order of the foreseen corrections can be changed, or single corrections may be
%revised. Again, the details how these decisions are made, may depend on the
%specific analysis. 
%%If I understand the implemented algorithm correctly, than the following is
%%happening:
%% A to be dropped because of C
%%  ...
%% C to be dropped because of X
%% Where A,B,C.. refer to the position in the map.
%% Then the last action (dropping of C) is not performed.
%%
%% -> In case of conflicts the position in the map defines which object is
%% removed, do I understand this correctly?
%% -> Shouldn't we had a case differentiation whether A or C is dropped, lets say
%% by pT?
%
%%Proposal:
%By default, from the set of map-entries that are in conflict with each other,
%that entry is removed from the map, whose object causing that entry is smallest
%in $p_T$. For each set of map-entries this step is repeated, until all
%conflicts are resolved.

%After the objects have been cross-cleaned, the properties of these objects have
%to be recalculated. All properties related to the energy deposition in the
%calorimeter or the cross-cleaning objects, may have changed. Isolation
%algorithms, energy scale correction algorithms, etc. have to be re-run.
% NO, isolation does not change, only JES corrections for the jets.

Subsequently the corrections are applied to the objects. Energy corrections for
all jets in the cleaned collection are being recalculated to ensure consistency
in the calibration.

A special object in the event is the missing transverse energy (MET). The raw
MET is calculated from calorimeter towers only and will not be changed by this
cross-cleaning. However, the JES correction to the missing $E_T$ can either be
recalculated using the new collections of corrected objects as input, or by
tracking the impact of each cross-cleaning modification on the MET. This
package~\cite{package} provides a corrected MET object using the latter way.
%Both ways should give the same result and the comparison is a valuable
%cross-check. 

The cross-cleaning package is an EDM producer which creates new collections for
the cross-cleaned objects. If for a specific event no cross-cleaning has taken
place these output collections are equal to the input collections.
In addition collections of dropped objects are created, i.e. if one object was
duplicated (e.g. an electron also reconstructed as a jet) than either
object is dropped and written into a ``dropped'' collection, while the other
object remains in the cleaned output collection.

An association of the cross-cleaned PAT objects in the new collections to the
objects before cleaning is always possible by comparing the references to the
original RECO objects (via PAT object member function
\texttt{originalObjectRef()}). 

%%@@ Does the following already work?
%% No!
%%For debugging purpose a reference map can be written into the event, that
%%associates every input object with the ouput object which can be either in the
%%normal output collection or in the ``dropped'' collection.
%% => No and we do not need it because one can always find the original object
%%    by comparison  of the originalObjectRef()

All parameters available for the steering of the module are listed in the
appendix. The general setup parameters and their default values can be found in
tables~\ref{tab:TurnOnModules}-\ref{tab:JetCorrections} including a short
description.

In the following sections the binary cleaners are explained in detail.

% ******************************************************************************

\section{Electron - Jet Cleaning}
\label{sec:ElecJet}
Electrons are reconstructed from clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter
whereas calorimeter towers used for jet clustering comprise energy in both the hadronic
and electromagnetic calorimeter. This implies that a fraction of the ECAL energy
might contribute to the reconstruction of two objects, namely an electron and a
jet. It is important to distinguish between the three cases of
\begin{enumerate}
\item  a real jet with a high electromagnetic fraction
\item an electron whose shower might have leaked into the hadronic
    calorimeter
\item an electron and a jet which are located very close together in the
    detector.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore the following procedure includes the possibilities to keep either the
jet or the electron or both objects in the event.

Starting point for this cleaning is a collection of well identified electrons.
The level of identification can be chosen from those provided by the EGamma POG
{\color{red}(put reference here)}.

The Electron-Jet cross cleaning was tested on {\color{red}Sample1, Sample2,
Sample3}. All plots in this section have been created from a LM4 Sample produced
with CMSSW 2.2.3. (\textcolor{red}{/DATASET/NAME/SOMEWHERE}). The PAT objects
have been generated using the default sequences provided in the configuration
files
\texttt{PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/patLayer0\_cff.py} and
\texttt{PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/patLayer1\_cff.py} in the CMSSW\_2\_2\_7
release.

\subsection{Algorithm}
The implemented algorithm is similar to the cleaning in the previous analysis
tool used in the SUSY PAG, the SusyAnalyzer~\cite{SusyAnalyzer}.

In very dense events as predicted for supersymmetric particle production, it is
not uncommon for an electromagnetic object to have shared energy with more than one jet (Fig. ~\ref{fig:NbJets}).

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figures/ElecJet/LM4_no_of_nnj.eps}
    \caption{Number of Jets with shared energy for isolated (dashed line) and non-isolated (solid line) electrons in an event.}
    \label{fig:NbJets}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Therefore for each electron the three closest jets in \( \eta-\phi\) space are
examined. If this distance is smaller than $\delta R=1.0$ (configurable) the
objects' constituents are compared in order to determine the amount of energy
which is being shared between the two objects.
This shared energy is calculated by adding up the electromagnetic energy of
those calorimeter towers which are covered by both objects, i.e. all jet towers
containing crystals which are part of the electrons' supercluster.
\footnote{Note that this is only an approximation to the real energy overlap. In
PAT Layer 1 smamples the more precise energies of individual crystals are not
accessible any more and cannot be used in the calculation.}
% Method using individual ECAL crystals 

If electron and jet share energy the further treatment depends on the isolation
of the electron. While the possible choices for the isolation algorithm include
the default PAT options like cone isolation in the Tracker, hadronic and
electromagnetic calorimeter, the presetting is a combination of these three, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{a\cdot ECalIso+b\cdot HCalIso+c\cdot TrackIso}{p_T}
    \label{ElIsolation}
\end{equation}
, with \(a=b=c=1\). This Isolation variable has been suggested by the V+jets
group.\textcolor{red}{Referece!}. Figure ~\ref{Iso} shows this combined
isolation for Electrons. The cut at \(0.1\) was also recommended in the V+jets
group baseline selection. \\

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/ElecJet/LM4_isolation_B.eps}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/ElecJet/LM4_isolation_A.eps}
    \caption{Combined isolation (see eq. (~\ref{ElIsolation})) for Electrons before (left) and after (right) cross cleaning.}
    \label{fig:ElectronIsolation}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

If it is non-isolated the electron will be removed and the difference between
the electron energy and the shared energy will be added to the jet. This energy
correction is applied vectorially. It is given by the difference of the electron
fourvector and a massless 'shared energy' fourvector ($E^2=\vec{p}^2$)
{\color{red}with \ldots}
% HOW exactly is this being calculated now?
For isolated electrons we distinguish two cases. If the ratio of shared energy
and jet energy is greater than a certain value the jet will be removed. If the
ratio is smaller both objects are kept and the shared energy fourvector is subtracted from
the jet. This way objects very close in $\Delta R$ can be kept in the events
without double counting of energy.\\

Fig.~\ref{fig:EJCleaning} illustrates the steps for the electron-jet cleaning.\\

    \includegraphics[scale=.6]{figures/ElectronJetAlgo_quer.eps}
    \caption{Steps of the electron-jet cleaning.}
    \label{fig:EJCleaning}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

% OK, now there should be s.th. concerning vectorial subtraction vs. scaling.
All cut values are configurable and are listed with their default settings in
table~\ref{tab:ElectronJetPar}.

\subsection{Results and Validation}
%% WHICH ELECTRON ID?
In this section the effect of the described procedure on electrons and jets in
the events is studied. 

\subsubsection{Cut Variables}
% (dR, shared energy, isolation) for different matches
As described in the previous section the cleaning algorithm applies cuts on
several variables concerning the electron and jet under investigation. These are
the distance of electron and jet in $\delta R$ and their shared energy,
normalised to the jet energy. The distributions of the named the variables are shown
in figure~\ref{fig:dR_sE_ElecJet_iso} (isolated electrons, before and after the
cleaning) and figure ~\ref{fig:dR_sE_ElecJet_noniso} (non-isolated electrons
before cleaning) respectively. By default the CombRelIso variable is considered.

We further investigate four different classes of electron-jet pairs. The
classification is based on the matching of the reconstructed objects
to generator particles produced in the hard process. We distinguish pairs in
which both, electron, jet or none of the objects could be matched to a generated
particle. The matching algorithm provided and used in the PAT applies a simple
$\delta R$ matching. {\color{red}(Check configuration)}.

%% Take out empty plot ....
%For any interpretation I need plots from the right samples....


%For electron-jet pairs lying close together the energy overlap is calculated.
%Figures~\ref{fig:sE_ElecJet_iso} and~\ref{fig:sE_ElecJet_noniso} show this
%shared energy divided by the jet's energy for isolated and non isolated
%electron. Again the four matching categories are drawn separately in the
%histograms.

\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Does not make sense to divide this into isolated and non isolated !

We observe a peak at $E_{shared}/E_{Jet}=1$ for isolated as well as for
non-isolated electrons. The peak contains mostly electrons which have a matched
generated electron but no matched generated parton/jet. Clearly the energy
deposition of the electron has been reconstructed as a jet. This motivates the
use of a cut on this ratio in order to reject fake jets. The effect of the
default cut value 0.7 is illustrated in the lower left plot of
figure~\ref{fig:dR_sE_ElecJet_iso}.\\

%The appearance of many non-isolated electrons with a generator match and
%many shared energy (cp. fig.~\ref{fig:dR_sE_ElecJet_noniso} might require a
%revision of the isolation criteria because all non-isolated electrons with
%an overlap are removed from the event (cp. figure~\ref{fig:iso_ElecJet}).

The peak of many non-isolated electrons with a generator match and large shared energy is caused by the hard cut on the isolation value. It vanishes if this cut is loosend.

%\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Selection Efficiency and Fake Rate}

Beside the attempt to remove double counted energy from the events, cross cleaning has also an impact at the selection efficiency and the contamination of the electrons. With the default settings, the efficiency drops around \(30 \%\), while the contaminations falls from \(\sim 70\%\) to \(\sim10\%\) (see figure ~\ref{fig:effCont_elec_ElecJet}). These effects are mainly taking place at the low \(p_T\) range. {\color{red}put some intelligent thoughts here.}\\
The selection efficiency and fake rate of the jets on the other hand is nearly not affected (figure ~\ref{fig:effCont_Jets_ElecJet}).

\end{center}
\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Resolution}


The spectrum of the \(p_T\) and \(\eta\) variables are shown in figure ~\ref{fig:objSpectra_ElecJet}. It appears that there is a shift from low \(p_T\) values to higher values. This is not surprising, because the soft electrons very often do not survive the ID check before the cross cleaning itself. Note that the spikes in the region of the intersection of barrel to endcap caused by fake electrons in the \(\eta\) distribution are also cleaned away. {\color{red}should be rewriten?}\\

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[hb]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/ElecJet/LM4_obj_pt.eps}

    and after the cross-cleaning.}
\label{fig:objSpectra_ElecJet}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also of interest is the spectrum of the so-called recoiled missing transverse energy (recoil met). It is calculated by adding up the fourvectors of all objects (passing the ID) in the event, that is electrons, muons, tau, jets, and photons (the latter can be excluded). The result for electron - jet cross cleaning is shown in figure ~\ref{fig:met_ElecJet} in comparison to the missing transverse energy from the calorimeter towers. While they are in good agreement at the lower energy range (up to \(\sim 500 GeV\)), the distributions differ in the tail. This gap is removed by using the cross cleaner.

% *** MUON-JET CLEANING ********************************************************

\clearpage
\section{Muon - Jet Cleaning}
The idea behind the muon-jet cleaning is to merge those muons into the jet which
are produced in this jet by decay-in-flight of b and c hadrons\footnote{The same
idea is pursued in the Jet Plus Track algorithms.}.

The user must take care not to include fake muons in the cleaning. Those can
result from punch-through of hadrons into the muon system and might have very
high transverse momentum which spoils the jet collection. An appropriate muon
identification can be chosen from the muon POG defaults {\color{red}(put reference to muon
ID note here)}.

The Muon-Jet cross cleaning was tested on \\
\texttt{/SUSY\_LM4-sftsht/Summer08\_IDEAL\_V11\_redigi\_v1/GEN-SIM-RECO} and\\
\texttt{/Zmumu/Summer08\_IDEAL\_V11\_redigi\_v2/GEN-SIM-RECO}.
All shown plots are from the LM4 Sample made with CMSSW 2.2.8. The PAT objects have been
generated using the default sequences provided in the configuration files\\
\texttt{PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/patLayer0\_cff.py} and\\
\texttt{PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/patLayer1\_cff.py} \\
in version {\color{red}\texttt{V04-14-19} True?}.
\\
Some plots made with the Zmumu sample can be found in appendix~\ref{app:Zmumu}.


\subsection{Algorithm}
In this cross-cleaner module all non-isolated muons are considered as part of the jet which
is within a distance of $\delta R=0.2$ . Isolation
refers either to both tracker and calorimeter or the CombRelIso variable. The
muon objects are removed and their fourvector added to the jet object. 
%(To avoid any double counting of energy we subtract the MIP
%signal of the muon in the calorimeter which is already contained in the
%jet. Still to add in the code!)
This is sketched in figure~\ref{fig:MJCleaning}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{figures/MuonJet/MuonJetAlgo_quer.eps}
\caption{Steps of the muon-jet cleaning.}
\label{fig:MJCleaning}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Again the cut values on the distance and isolation are configurable (see
tab.~\ref{tab:MuonJetPar}). A switch has been introduced to turn off
the correction of the jet energy. This is meant to be used in combination with
JPT where the muon energy has already been added in the jet reconstruction but
the muon has not yet been removed.

\subsection{Validation}
\subsubsection{Cut Variables}
In the muon - jet cross cleaning the isolation is used to decide wich muon is candidate for removing and wich not. Figure~\ref{fig:MuonIsolation} shows the combined isolation as defined in eq.(~\ref{ElIsolation}) for muons before and after the cleaning. The preset isolation cut is on \(0.1\) \(G\)e\(V\). 


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[hb]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/MuonJet/LM4_iso_Muon_before.eps}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/MuonJet/LM4_iso_Muon_after.eps}
    \caption{Combined isolation for muons before (left) and after (right) the muon-jet cross cleaning.}
\label{fig:MuonIsolation}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Then, the distance \(\delta R\) between the (non-isolated) muon and all jets in \(\eta - \phi\) space is calculated. If there exists a jet which is closer than a certain value (preset is \(\delta R < 0.2\)), the muon will be removed, otherwise both muon and jets will be left alone. Figure~\ref{fig:dR_MuonJet_noniso} shows this for before and after the cross cleaning. As the energy correcion of the jet is a vectorial correction, it may happen that a jet, which is not in cleaning distance of a non-isolated muon before the cleaning, is moved into cleaning distance after the cross cleaning. This effect can also be seen in figure~\ref{fig:dR_MuonJet_noniso}.

    \caption{\(\delta R\) between non-isolated muon and jet before (left) and after (right) the muon-jet cross cleaning.}
\label{fig:dR_MuonJet_noniso}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Selection Efficiency and Fake Rate}
The greatest influence of muon - jet cross cleaning is on the contamination of the muons. It drops from \(40 \%\) to \(10 \%\) with the default settings. The selection efficiency on the other hand also decreases, but stays good (\(\sim 90\%\)). This can be seen in figure~\ref{effCont_muon_MuonJet} for the \(p_T\) and \(\eta\) distributions. 

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\label{fig:effCont_muon_MuonJet}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, this cross cleaning module has nearly no impact on selection efficiency and contamination of the jets (figure~\ref{effCont_Jets_MuonJet}).

\subsubsection{Resolution}
As shown in the \(p_T\) spectrum of the muons in figure~\ref{fig:ObjSpectra_MuonJet} (left), the cross cleaning effects mainly the soft muons, located more centrally in terms of pseudorapidity (right).

\section{Photon - Jet Cleaning}
In the CMS default reconstruction photons are selected with rather loose criteria
from all reconstructed superclusters in the event. Like in the case of electrons
an adequate photon identification must be applied in order to remove fake and/or
non-isolated photons. Any photon entering the cross-cleaning must fulfill the
requirements of a certain identification, which can be chosen from the ones
deployed by the EGamma POG (put a reference here). 

Again the energy deposit in the supercluster might also be part of a
calorimeter tower and thus be used in jet reconstruction. These ambiguities in
the assignment of energy to the objects are resolved in a scheme similar to the
electron-jet disambiguation described in section~\ref{sec:ElecJet}. 
%Note that the jet is only removed if it shares its entire energy with a photon
%% NOT ANY MORE
(cp.~fig.~\ref{fig:PJCleaning}).

\section{Electron - Photon Cleaning}
Both kinds of objects are reconstructed from superclusters in the
electromagnetic calorimeter. Before object identification procedures are applied
the electron collection is just a subset of the photon collection (put a
reference here) with the additional requirement that a track matches the
supercluster. For disambiguation it is necessary to remove those photons which
share the supercluster seed or even supercluster with a good electron.
Therefore the reference to the supercluster (seed) of all electron-photon pairs
in the event are compared and duplicates are removed from the photon collection
(Fig.~\ref{fig:EPCleaning}). The electron collection is not affected by this
module. This module does not have configurable parameters.

\section{Resolving Conflicts}
\label{mapReso}
All overlaps detected in the comparison of collections among each other are
being stored in an association map as described above. The next step in the cleaning procedure
consists of finding contradictions in this map and resolving them.
Possible configurations needing such an intervention are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Object A is marked to be \textit{deleted} because of overlap with
	object B and marked for \textit{modification} due to a conflict with
	object C
    \item Object A is marked to be \textit{deleted} because of overlap with object B
	which itself is marked for deletion due to a conflict with object C.
%    \item Object A is marked to be \textit{modified} because of overlap with object B
%	which itself is marked for deletion due to a conflict with object C.
%	NOT YET RESOLVED AND RATHER IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO STRUCTURE OF THE MAP
    \item A closed loop of dependencies (Fig. XXX) % To be created
\end{enumerate}

% Explain how this can occur, examples

The first case is being handled at the point where the clean collections are
being created. The action of deletion gets priority over all other
modifications.

In order to find conflicts of the other kinds all map entries are inspected. For
each entry those modifier objects leading to a deletion are checked whether they
appear themselves in the map as a modified object marked for deletion. If this
is the case a conflict of type 2 has been found. As a consequence the initial
action (removal of object A)  should not take place and the corresponding
modifier (object B) is removed from the list of modifier objects.

For the detection of a loop of dependencies not only the modifiers of the
starting object must be checked but iteratively all the modifiers' modifier. A
bookkeeping of all objects appearing in the procedure allows the detection of
the loop.

Once a loop has been detected some modifications to the map become necessary.
The idea is to keep the most energetic object of the loop (the highest in
$p_T$). Therefore the list of modifiers of this kept object is cleared off by
removing all other objects appearing in the loop. % IS THIS REALLY DONE? CHECK!
The same is done for these other objects but in addition the kept object is
added as a modifier marking them for deletion. The new topology is sketched in
Fig. XXX %TO BE CREATED
